In this paper we proposed network subsystem architecture for collaborative mind
mapping based on the XMPP pubsub extension protocol. Our approach was
successfully implemented in HiveMind application, which allows teamwork mode on
various platforms including Maemo, MeeGo Netbook, and GNU/Linux.

HiveMind application can be downloaded from the project homepage at the
following URL: \emph{http://linuxlab.corp7.uniyar.ac.ru/projects/hivemind}. The
source codes are available from the Mercurial repository at
\emph{http://linuxlab.corp7.uniyar.ac.ru/hgpub/hivemind}.

The implemented network subsystem operates in terms of abstract commands, which
makes it loosely coupled from the application domain. It also makes possible to
spread our teamwork architecture to a broader class of applications which could
benefit from collaborative document editing.

Another direction for future development of the project is integration with
SmartConference System. This kind of work is in progress now.
